## Codebase Patterns
- html2canvas 1.4.1 has built-in types, do NOT install @types/html2canvas (causes type conflicts)
- Storage utils were refactored from x/y position to corner-based positioning (saveCorner/loadCorner)
- Widget uses corner snapping: bottom-right, bottom-left, top-right, top-left
- Screenshot utilities are in src/components/FeedbackWidget/utils/screenshot.ts
- Selection mode uses canvas-based lasso drawing instead of DOM element highlighting
- Canvas overlay is in Shadow DOM; update counter/warning text in-place to avoid destroying event listeners
- DrawnRectangle interface tracks x, y, width, height, id, number for each lasso region

## 2026-01-14 16:35 - STORY-018
- What was implemented:
  - Installed html2canvas library for screen capture
  - Created screenshot.ts utility module with CapturedScreenshot interface
  - captureRegion(x, y, width, height) returns Promise<Blob>
  - captureScreenshot() returns full CapturedScreenshot object with blob URL
  - Validation: regions < 10x10 throw "Selection too small"
  - Regions > 2000px in either dimension are scaled down proportionally
- Files changed:
  - package.json - added html2canvas dependency
  - src/components/FeedbackWidget/utils/screenshot.ts - new file
  - tests/unit/screenshot.test.ts - new file with 15 tests
  - tests/unit/widget.test.ts - fixed pre-existing storage tests to use corner API
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - html2canvas 1.4.1 ships with its own TypeScript types in dist/types/
  - @types/html2canvas is for version 0.5 and conflicts with modern html2canvas types
  - The storage.ts API was refactored from position-based to corner-based in STORY-017
  - html2canvas options x, y, width, height are in RenderOptions interface

## 2026-01-14 16:45 - STORY-019
- What was implemented:
  - Rewrote SelectionMode.tsx to use full-viewport canvas overlay
  - Canvas has crosshair cursor and is transparent
  - Mousedown/mousemove/mouseup draws lasso rectangles
  - Rectangle styling: Sonance blue (#00A3E1) 2px border, 20% opacity fill
  - Numbered badges drawn on canvas at top-left of each completed rectangle
  - Maximum 5 rectangles with warning when limit exceeded
  - ESC key cancels and exits selection mode
  - Done button exits selection mode
  - Screenshot capture triggers on mouseup with valid region
  - Updated index.tsx to manage capturedScreenshots and drawnRectangles state
  - Counter updates in-place without destroying canvas/event listeners
- Files changed:
  - src/components/FeedbackWidget/SelectionMode.tsx - complete rewrite for canvas
  - src/components/FeedbackWidget/index.tsx - replaced element selection with screenshot capture
  - tests/e2e/feedback-flow.spec.ts - updated tests for canvas-based selection
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - When updating Shadow DOM content, avoid replacing entire overlay to preserve canvas and listeners
  - Use querySelector to find and update specific text elements (counter, warnings) instead
  - html2canvas may fail silently in headless browsers; E2E tests should be lenient about counter value
  - canvasUtils.normalizeRect() handles negative width/height from dragging any direction

## 2026-01-14 16:50 - STORY-020
- What was implemented:
  - Created ScreenshotList.tsx component for displaying screenshot thumbnails
  - 48x48px thumbnails in horizontal row with numbered badges
  - Each thumbnail has remove (X) button that appears on hover
  - Click thumbnail to show larger preview (200px max dimension)
  - Preview shows in overlay with click-to-close functionality
  - Clear all button removes all screenshots
  - Collapsed state shows "X screenshots" badge
  - Expanded state shows thumbnail grid
  - Uses Sonance brand colors and styling
- Files changed:
  - src/components/FeedbackWidget/ScreenshotList.tsx - new file
  - src/components/FeedbackWidget/styles.ts - import ScreenshotList styles
  - src/components/FeedbackWidget/FeedbackForm.tsx - integrate ScreenshotList
  - src/components/FeedbackWidget/index.tsx - add screenshot list event handlers
  - tests/e2e/feedback-flow.spec.ts - added 3 new tests for screenshot thumbnails
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - ShadowRoot doesn't have insertAdjacentHTML; use createElement + appendChild instead
  - Screenshot list uses similar pattern to ElementList but with image thumbnails
  - Click handlers on thumbnails need stopPropagation to not interfere with remove button
  - E2E tests for screenshot list are lenient since html2canvas may fail in headless browsers

## 2026-01-14 16:51 - STORY-021
- What was implemented:
  - Added uploadScreenshot(blob, appId, index) function to src/lib/supabase.ts
  - Function uploads screenshots to 'feedback-screenshots' Supabase Storage bucket
  - Storage path format: {appId}/{timestamp}-{index}.png
  - Returns { url: string, storagePath: string } on success, null on failure
  - Graceful handling when Supabase client is not configured
  - Created 002_screenshots.sql migration for storage bucket with RLS policies
  - Public uploads allowed, public read access, authenticated delete
  - Unit tests with mocked Supabase client verify upload function interface
- Files changed:
  - src/lib/supabase.ts - added uploadScreenshot function and UploadScreenshotResult interface
  - supabase/migrations/002_screenshots.sql - new file for storage bucket creation
  - tests/unit/supabase.test.ts - new file with 10 tests for upload function
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Supabase Storage uses client.storage.from(bucket).upload() and .getPublicUrl() APIs
  - Storage RLS policies go on storage.objects table, not custom tables
  - Mock Supabase client by mocking the @supabase/supabase-js module with vi.mock()
  - Use vi.resetModules() in beforeEach when testing environment variable changes
